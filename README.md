# Inspiration Behind TrueConsensus 🌟
It all started with our shared frustration over opaque ranking sites and clunky group chat polls. We were fed up with hidden algorithms that left users guessing how votes were counted, breeding distrust and skepticism. That’s when **TrueConsensus** was born—a platform designed to shatter the mystery and revolutionize voting. By eliminating the need to create polls in group chats, we deliver a seamless, transparent experience where every vote counts right on the website.

## Why We Built TrueConsensus 🚀
Our mission is clear: **restore trust and clarity to the voting process**. We built TrueConsensus as an **open-source** platform featuring an algorithm that anyone can inspect, verify, and even modify. This isn’t just about voting—it’s about empowering you with complete visibility and control over the process.
